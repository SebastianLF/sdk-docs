# Get Started


## Environment

Current version of package is `0.0.5` and it is written as ES module. The list of peer dependencies includes:

```bash
"@ethersproject/contracts": "^5.5.0",
"@ethersproject/providers": "^5.5.3",
"@ethersproject/units": "^5.5.0",
"axios": "^0.25.0",
"ethers": "^5.5.4"
```

In order for the package to work properly be sure to install these packages in your project.


## Before to start

Further in the documentation you will find `marketRegistryId`, `outcomeRegistryId`, `paramId`. These properties refer to
the values that can be found in [Registry](/registry/outcome-registry) chapter. You can use this library in your code, or
take it as an example to write your own.


## Step-by-Step guide to start using Azuro SDK

### Install the package

```bash
npm install @azuro-protocol/sdk
```


### Install peer dependencies

```bash
npm install @ethersproject/contracts@^5.5.0 @ethersproject/providers@^5.5.3 @ethersproject/units@^5.5.0 axios@^0.25.0 ethers@^5.5.4
```


### Configure

You need to specify which provider ([Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [Infura](https://infura.io/)) to use to allow the package to read data from blockchain.

```js
import { configure } from '@azuro-protocol/sdk'

configure({
  alchemyKey: '<your_alchemy_key>',
  infuraKey: '<your_infura_key>',
  rpcUrl: '<RPC_url>',
})
```

<Callout>
Note that the package was tested with Rinkeby and Goerli networks. Alchemy doesn't support Goerli network, so if you'd like
to use Goerli be sure to use Rinkeby key when configuring.
</Callout>


### Setup chain ID

Before you start using SDK API you should set used chain ID to specify the Network with which the SDK should interact.

```js
import { setSelectedChainId } from '@azuro-protocol/sdk'

setSelectedChainId(4) // Rinkeby
```


### Fetch games

Now you can read a data from blockchain. Lets start with fetching games.

```js
import { fetchGames } from '@azuro-protocol/sdk'

const games = await fetchGames()
```

`fetchGames()` returns list of games which have ever been created. To specify fetching data use filters. By default
fetchGames uses `resolved: true` and `canceled: true` filters.

```js
const games = await fetchGames({
  filters: {
    resolved: false, // filters games for which there is a result
    canceled: false, // filters games which were canceled
  }
})
```

Each item of the list has following structure:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "state": 0,
  "league": "League 1 - Round 23",
  "country": "France",
  "participants": [
    {
      "name": "Olympique de Marseille",
      "image": "..."
    }, {
      "name": "Olympique de Marseille",
      "image": "..."
    }
  ],
  "marketRegistryId": 9,
  "startsAt": 1643901853862,
  "conditions": [
    {
      "paramId": null,
      "odds": [
        {
          "conditionId": 5701,
          "outcomeId": 23,
          "outcomeRegistryId": 180,
          "value": 1.88
        },
        {
          "conditionId": 5701,
          "outcomeId": 24,
          "outcomeRegistryId": 181,
          "value": 2.15
        },
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| id | Number | Game ID |
| state | Number | Game status. 0 - Active. 1 - Resolved. 2 - Canceled |
| league | String | Contains info about league and round |
| country | String | League country |
| participants | Array | List of participants. Each participant has "name" and "image" |
| startsAt | Number | Timestamp. Date when this game starts |
| marketRegistryId | Number | [registry](/registry/outcome-registry) |
| conditions | Array | Read about it [here](/conditions-scheme) |


### Setup wallet provider

To send write requests (signed transactions) into blockchain you need to specify a wallet provider. In the example
below we used `@web3-react/core` package to interact with user wallet.

```js
import { useWeb3React } from '@web3-react/core'
import { setWallerProvider } from '@azuro-protocol/sdk'

const { library } = useWeb3React()

setWallerProvider(library)
```

<Callout>
This method should be called before any "write request", otherwise an error will be thrown.
</Callout>


### Approve

Before users can place their first bet they need to allow contracts to spend users tokens. Read about approve and
allowance [here](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20).

```js
import { USDT_DECIMALS, fetchAllowance, approve } from '@azuro-protocol/sdk'
import { formatUnits, parseUnits } from '@ethersproject/units'

const rawAllowance = await fetchAllowance()
const allowance = formatUnits(rawAllowance, USDT_DECIMALS)

if (allowance < betAmount) {
  const rawBetAmount = parseUnits(String(betAmount), USDT_DECIMALS)

  const receipt = await approve(rawBetAmount)
  const trxHash = await receipt.wait()
}
```

If you'd like to approve max amount then do:

```js
import { constants } from 'ethers'

const receipt = await approve(constants.MaxUint256)
const trxHash = await receipt
```


### Calculate odds

The betting odds directly depend on bet amount. To get actual odds values you should recalculate them.

```js
import { calculateActualOdds } from '@azuro-protocol/sdk'

const betRate = await calculateActualOdds({ conditionId, outcomeId, betAmount })
```


### Place a bet

```js
import { USDT_DECIMALS, placeBet } from '@azuro-protocol/sdk'

const receipt = await placeBet({
  conditionId,
  outcomeId,
  amount,
  slippage,
  betRate,
  affiliate,
})
const trxHash = await receipt
```

| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| conditionId | Number | Should be taken from "conditions.odds" JSON |
| outcomeId | Number | Should be taken from "conditions.odds" JSON |
| amount | Number | Bet amount |
| slippage | Number | Bet rate slippage. Value is % from 0 to 100 |
| betRate | Number | Bet kef. It's "value" property stored in "conditions.odds" JSON |
| affiliate | String | **Optional**. Affiliate address<br />*//TODO leave a link for detailed info* |


### Fetch placed bets

```js
import { fetchUserBets } from '@azuro-protocol/sdk'

const userBets = await fetchUserBets({ account: userAccountAddress })
```

`fetchUserBets()` returns list of bets placed by specific user. Each item of the list has following structure:

```json
{
  "nftId": 1,
  "conditionId": 1,
  "paramId": 1,
  "outcomeRegistryId": 1,
  "rate": 1.9,
  "amount": 100,
  "result": 190,
  "createdAt": 1643901853862,
  "isRedeemed": false,
  "gameInfo": {
    "id": 1,
    "state": 0,
    "league": "League 1 - Round 23",
    "country": "France",
    "participants": [
      {
        "name": "Olympique de Marseille",
        "image": "..."
      }, {
        "name": "Olympique de Marseille",
        "image": "..."
      }
    ],
    "startsAt": 1643901853862,
  },
}
```

<Callout>
Note that "gameInfo" doesn't contain "marketRegistryId".<br />
For not started, active or not resolved games result value is NULL.<br />
For canceled games result value is equal to bet "amount".
</Callout>


| Property | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| nftId | Number | ERC721 token ID |
| conditionId | Number |  |
| paramId | Number | [registry](/registry/param) |
| outcomeRegistryId | Number | [registry](/registry/outcome-registry) |
| rate | Number | Bet rate |
| amount | Number | Bet amount |
| result | Number |  |
| createdAt | Timestamp | Date when bet was placed |
| isRedeemed | Boolean | Indicates whether there was a bid redeemed or not |
| gameInfo | Object | Game information |


### Redeem bet prize

```js
import { redeemBetPrize } from '@azuro-protocol/sdk'

const receipt = await redeemBetPrize(nftId)
const trxHash = await receipt
```
